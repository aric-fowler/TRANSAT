.SH NAME
.PP
satAttack - A SAT attack program, developed for launching SAT attacks on
transistor-level circuits.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]satAttack\f[R] [\f[I]OPTION\f[R]] plLogicFile ioCSV oracleNetlist
topLevelModule
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]satAttack\f[R] runs a SAT attack on an encrypted Z3Py netlist,
using a provided oracle netlist that contains the programmed
functionality.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]\[en]help\f[R]
Display help message.
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R], \f[B]\[en]fresh\f[R]
Creates fresh directories for all script outputs.
WARNING: deletes prexisting directories.
.TP
\f[B]-o\f[R], \f[B]\[en]oracleType\f[R]
Setting this true indicates that an oracle does not express tri-state
logic at its outputs, despite the target netlist being capable of doing
so.
This argument is only taken into account when \[en]tristate is set is
set.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R], \f[B]\[en]quiet\f[R]
Stops printing of SAT attack results to terminal.
Recommended when optimizing runtime or for attacks with many keys.
.TP
\f[B]-z\f[R], \f[B]\[en]tristate\f[R]
Enables the verification tool to consider outputs that may have
high-impedance functionality.
May be needed for proper attack on circuits that have tri-state outputs
or transistor-level behavior (like T-gates).
Expects HiZ variables correlating to output variables to be placed in
the ioCSV file after the \[lq]output\[rq] value.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\f[B]satAttack plFile.py ioList.csv oracle.v topName -f\f[R]
Runs a SAT attack on the encrypted circuit described in plFile.py,
against the oracle \[lq]topName\[rq] described in oracle.v.
