.SH NAME
.PP
satAttack - A SAT attack program, developed for launching SAT attacks on
UTD\[cq]s TRAnsistor-level Programmable (TRAP) fabric.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]satAttack\f[R] [\f[I]OPTION\f[R]]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]satAttack\f[R] runs a SAT attack on a
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R]
Display help message
.TP
\f[B]-f\f[R]
Creates fresh directories for all script outputs.
WARNING: deletes prexisting directories.
.TP
\f[B]-q\f[R]
Stops printing of SAT attack results to terminal.
Recommended when optimizing runtime or for attacks with many keys.
.TP
\f[B]-z\f[R]
Enables the SAT attack to consider outputs that may have high-impedance
functionality.
May be needed for proper attack on circuits that have tri-state outputs
or
transistor-level behavior (like T-gates).
Expects a text file containing names of \[lq]hiZ output\[rq] variables,
separated by whitespaces.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\f[B]satAttack plFile.py ins.txt keys.txt outs.txt oracle.v topName -fv\f[R]
Runs a SAT attack on the encrypted circuit described in plFile.py,
against the oracle \[lq]topName\[rq] described in oracle.v.
